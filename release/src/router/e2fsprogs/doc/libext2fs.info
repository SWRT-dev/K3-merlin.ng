2.1 Filesystem-level functions
==============================

The following functions operate on a filesystem handle.  Most EXT2FS
Library functions require a filesystem handle as their first argument.
There are two functions which create a filesystem handle, 'ext2fs_open'
and 'ext2fs_initialize'.

   The filesystem can also be closed using 'ext2fs_close', and any
changes to the superblock and group descripts can be written out to disk
using 'ext2fs_flush'.

2.1.1 Opening an ext2 filesystem
--------------------------------

Most libext2fs functions take a filesystem handle of type 'ext2_filsys'.
A filesystem handle is created either by opening an existing function
using 'ext2fs_open', or by initializing a new filesystem using
'ext2fs_initialize'.

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_open (const char *NAME, int FLAGS, int
          SUPERBLOCK, int BLOCK_SIZE, io_manager MANAGER, ext2_filsys
          *RET_FS)

     Opens a filesystem named NAME, using the the io_manager MANAGER to
     define the input/output routines needed to read and write the
     filesystem.  In the case of the 'unix_io' io_manager, NAME is
     interpreted as the Unix filename of the filesystem image.  This is
     often a device file, such as '/dev/hda1'.

     The SUPERBLOCK parameter specifies the block number of the
     superblock which should be used when opening the filesystem.  If
     SUPERBLOCK is zero, 'ext2fs_open' will use the primary superblock
     located at offset 1024 bytes from the start of the filesystem
     image.

     The BLOCK_SIZE parameter specifies the block size used by the
     filesystem.  Normally this is determined automatically from the
     filesystem uperblock.  If BLOCK_SIZE is non-zero, it must match the
     block size found in the superblock, or the error
     'EXT2_ET_UNEXPECTED_BLOCK_SIZE' will be returned.  The BLOCK_SIZE
     parameter is also used to help fund the superblock when SUPERBLOCK
     is non-zero.

     The FLAGS argument contains a bitmask of flags which control how
     the filesystem open should be handled.

     'EXT2_FLAG_RW'
          Open the filesystem for reading and writing.  Without this
          flag, the filesystem is opened for reading only.

     'EXT2_FLAG_FORCE'
          Open the filesystem regardless of the feature sets listed in
          the superblock.

2.1.2 Closing and flushing out changes
--------------------------------------

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_flush (ext2_filsys FS)

     Write any changes to the high-level filesystem data structures in
     the FS filesystem.  The following data structures will be written
     out:

        * The filesystem superblock
        * The filesystem group descriptors
        * The filesystem bitmaps, if read in via 'ext2fs_read_bitmaps'.

 -- Function: void ext2fs_free (ext2_filsys FS)

     Close the io_manager abstraction for FS and release all memory
     associated with the filesystem handle.

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_close (ext2_filsys FS)

     Flush out any changes to the high-level filesystem data structures
     using 'ext2fs_flush' if the filesystem is marked dirty; then close
     and free the filesystem using 'ext2fs_free'.

2.1.3 Initializing a filesystem
-------------------------------

An ext2 filesystem is initializing by the 'mke2fs' program.  The two
functions described here, 'ext2fs_initialize' and
'ext2fs_allocate_tables' do much of the initial work for setting up a
filesystem.  However, they don't do the whole job.  'mke2fs' calls
'ext2fs_initialize' to set up the filesystem superblock, and calls
'ext2fs_allocate_tables' to allocate space for the inode table, and the
inode and block bitmaps.  In addition, 'mke2fs' must also initialize the
inode tables by clearing them with zeros, create the root and lost+found
directories, and reserve the reserved inodes.

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_initialize (const char *NAME, int FLAGS,
          struct ext2_super_block *PARAM, io_manager MANAGER,
          ext2_filsys *RET_FS)

     This function is used by the 'mke2fs' program to initialize a
     filesystem.  The 'ext2fs_initialize' function creates a filesystem
     handle which is returned in RET_FS that has been properly setup for
     a filesystem to be located in NAME, using the io_manager MANAGER.
     The prototype superblock in PARAM is used to supply parameters such
     as the number of blocks in the filesystem, the block size, etc.

     The 'ext2fs_initialize' function does not actually do any I/O; that
     will be done when the application program calls 'ext2fs_close' or
     'ext2fs_flush'.  Also, this function only initializes the
     superblock and group descriptor structures.  It does not create the
     inode table or the root directory.  This must be done by the
     calling application, such as 'mke2fs'.

     The following values may be set in the PARAM prototype superblock;
     if a value of 0 is found in a field, 'ext2fs_initialize' will use a
     default value.  The calling application should zero out the
     prototype entire superblock, and then fill in any appropriate
     values.

     's_blocks_count'
          The number of blocks in the filesystem.  This parameter is
          mandatory and must be set by the calling application.

     's_inodes_count'
          The number of inodes in the filesystem.  The default value is
          determined by calculating the size of the filesystem, and
          creating one inode for every 4096 bytes.

     's_r_blocks_count'
          The number of blocks which should be reserved for the
          superuser.  The default value is zero blocks.

     's_log_block_size'
          The blocksize of the filesystem.  Valid values are 0 (1024
          bytes), 1 (2048 bytes), or 2 (4096 bytes).  The default
          blocksize is 1024 bytes.

     's_log_frag_size'
          The size of fragments.  The ext2 filesystem does not support
          fragments (and may never support fragments).  Currently this
          field must be the same as 's_log_block_size'.

     's_first_data_block'
          The first data block for the filesystem.  For filesystem with
          a blocksize of 1024 bytes, this value must be at least 1,
          since the superblock is located in block number 1.  For
          filesystems with larger blocksizes, the superblock is still
          located at an offset of 1024 bytes, so the superblock is
          located in block number 0.  By default, this value is set to 1
          for filesystems with a block size of 1024 bytes, or 0 for
          filesystems with larger blocksizes.

     's_max_mnt_count'
          This field defines the number of times that the filesystem can
          be mounted before it should be checked using 'e2fsck'.  When
          'e2fsck' is run without the '-f' option, 'e2fsck' will skip
          the filesystem check if the number of times that the
          filesystem has been mounted is less than 's_max_mnt_count' and
          if the interval between the last time a filesystem check was
          performed and the current time is less than 's_checkinterval'
          (see below).  The default value of 's_max_mnt_count' is 20.

     's_checkinterval'
          This field defines the minimal interval between filesystem
          checks.  See the previous entry for a discussion of how this
          field is used by 'e2fsck'.  The default value of this field is
          180 days (six months).

     's_errors'
          This field defines the behavior which should be used by the
          kernel of errors are detected in the filesystem.  Possible
          values include:

          'EXT2_ERRORS_CONTINUE'
               Continue execution when errors are detected.

          'EXT2_ERRORS_RO'
               Remount the filesystem read-only.

          'EXT2_ERRORS_PANIC'
               Panic.

          The default behavior is 'EXT2_ERRORS_CONTINUE'.

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_allocate_tables (ext2_filsys FS)
     Allocate space for the inode table and the block and inode bitmaps.
     The inode tables and block and inode bitmaps aren't actually
     initialized; this function just allocates the space for them.


File: libext2fs.info,  Node: Filesystem flag functions,  Prev: Initializing a filesystem,  Up: Filesystem-level functions

2.1.4 Filesystem flag functions
-------------------------------

The filesystem handle has a number of flags which can be manipulated
using the following function.  Some of these flags affect how the
libext2fs filesystem behaves; others are provided solely for the
application's convenience.

 -- Function: void ext2fs_mark_changed (ext2_filsys FS)
 -- Function: int ext2fs_test_changed (ext2_filsys FS)
     This flag indicates whether or not the filesystem has been changed.
     It is not used by the ext2fs library.

 -- Function: void ext2fs_mark_super_dirty (ext2_filsys FS)
     Mark the filesystem FS as being dirty; this will cause the
     superblock information to be flushed out when 'ext2fs_close' is
     called.  'ext2fs_mark_super_dirty' will also set the filesystem
     changed flag.  The dirty flag is automatically cleared by
     'ext2fs_flush' when the superblock is written to disk.

 -- Function: void ext2fs_mark_valid (ext2_filsys FS)
 -- Function: void ext2fs_unmark_valid (ext2_filsys FS)
 -- Function: int ext2fs_test_valid (ext2_filsys FS)
     This flag indicates whether or not the filesystem is free of
     errors.  It is not used by libext2fs, and is solely for the
     application's convenience.

 -- Function: void ext2fs_mark_ib_dirty (ext2_filsys FS)
 -- Function: void ext2fs_mark_bb_dirty (ext2_filsys FS)
 -- Function: int ext2fs_test_ib_dirty (ext2_filsys FS)
 -- Function: int ext2fs_test_bb_dirty (ext2_filsys FS)
     These flags indicate whether or not the inode or block bitmaps have
     been modified.  If the flag is set, it will cause the appropriate
     bitmap to be written when the filesystem is closed or flushed.

2.2 File I/O Functions
======================

The following functions provide a convenient abstraction to read or
write a file in an filesystem.  The interface is similar in spirit to
the Linux/POSIX file I/O system calls.

* File handle manipulation::    
* Reading and writing data::    
* Changing the file offset ::   
* Getting the file size::       


File: libext2fs.info,  Node: File handle manipulation,  Next: Reading and writing data,  Prev: File I/O Functions,  Up: File I/O Functions

2.2.1 File handle manipulation
------------------------------

The file handle functions much like a file descriptor in the Linux/POSIX
file I/O system calls.  Unlike the Linux/POSIX system calls, files are
opened via inode numbers instead of via pathnames.  To resolve a
pathname to an inode number, use the function 'ext2fs_namei' or to
create a new file, use 'ext2fs_new_inode' and 'ext2fs_link'.

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_file_open2 (ext2_filsys FS, ext2_ino_t
          INO, struct ext2_inode *INODE, int FLAGS, ext2_file_t *RET)
 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_file_open (ext2_filsys FS, ext2_ino_t
          INO, int FLAGS, ext2_file_t *RET)

     Opens a file identified by inode number INO in filesystem FS and
     returns a file handle in RET.  If an inode structure is provided in
     INODE, then it is used instead of reading the inode from the
     filesystem.

     The FLAGS argument contains a bitmask of flags which control how
     the file should be opened.

     'EXT2_FILE_WRITE'
          Open the file for reading and writing.  Without this flag, the
          file is opened for writing only.

     'EXT2_FILE_CREATE'
          Create the file if it is not already present.

 -- Function: ext2_filsys ext2fs_file_get_fs (ext2_file_t FILE)
     Return the filesystem handle where the open file FILE was opened.

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_file_close (ext2_file_t FILE)
     Close the file handle FILE.

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_file_flush (ext2_file_t FILE)
     Force any data written via 'ext2fs_file_write' to disk.

2.2.2 Reading and writing data
------------------------------

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_file_read (ext2_file_t FILE, void *BUF,
          unsigned int WANTED, unsigned int *GOT)
     Read WANTED bytes of data from FILE store it in the buffer BUF.
     The number of bytes that was actually read is returned via GOT.

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_file_write (ext2_file_t FILE, const void
          *BUF, unsigned int NBYTES, unsigned int *WRITTEN)
     Write WANTED bytes of data from the buffer BUF to the current file
     position of FILE.  The number of bytes that was actually written is
     returned via GOT.

2.2.3 Changing the file offset
------------------------------

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_file_llseek (ext2_file_t FILE, __u64
          OFFSET, int WHENCE, __u64 *RET_POS)
 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_file_lseek (ext2_file_t FILE, ext2_off_t
          OFFSET, int WHENCE, ext2_off_t *RET_POS)
     Change the current file position of FILE according to the directive
     WHENCE as follows:

     'EXT2_SEEK_SET'
          The file position is set to OFFSET bytes from the beginning of
          the file.

     'EXT2_SEEK_CUR'
          The file position set to its current location plus OFFSET
          bytes.

     'EXT2_SEEK_END'
          The file position is set to the size of the file plus OFFSET
          bytes.

     The current offset is returned via RET_POS.

2.2.4 Getting the file size
---------------------------

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_file_get_lsize (ext2_file_t FILE, __u64
          *RET_SIZE)
     Return the size of the file FILE in RET_SIZE.

--------------------------------

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_read_inode (ext2_filsys FS, ext2_ino_t
          INO, struct ext2_inode *INODE)
     Read the inode number INO into INODE.

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_write_inode (ext2_filsys FS, ext2_ino_t
          INO, struct ext2_inode *INODE)
     Write INODE to inode INO.

2.3.2 Iterating over inodes in a filesystem
-------------------------------------------

The inode_scan abstraction is useful for iterating over all the inodes
in a filesystem.

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_open_inode_scan (ext2_filsys FS, int
          BUFFER_BLOCKS, ext2_inode_scan *SCAN)
     Initialize the iteration variable SCAN.  This variable is used by
     'ext2fs_get_next_inode'.  The BUFFER_BLOCKS parameter controls how
     many blocks of the inode table are read in at a time.  A large
     number of blocks requires more memory, but reduces the overhead in
     seeking and reading from the disk.  If BUFFER_BLOCKS is zero, a
     suitable default value will be used.

 -- Function: void ext2fs_close_inode_scan (ext2_inode_scan SCAN)
     Release the memory associated with SCAN and invalidate it.

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_get_next_inode (ext2_inode_scan SCAN,
          ext2_ino_t *INO, struct ext2_inode *INODE)

     This function returns the next inode from the filesystem; the inode
     number of the inode is stored in INO, and the inode is stored in
     INODE.

     If the inode is located in a block that has been marked as bad,
     'ext2fs_get_next_inode' will return the error
     'EXT2_ET_BAD_BLOCK_IN_INODE_TABLE'.

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_inode_scan_goto_blockgroup
          (ext2_inode_scan SCAN, int GROUP)
     Start the inode scan at a particular ext2 blockgroup, GROUP.  This
     function may be safely called at any time while SCAN is valid.

 -- Function: void ext2fs_set_inode_callback (ext2_inode_scan SCAN,
          errcode_t (*done_group)(ext2_filsys FS, ext2_inode_scan SCAN,
          dgrp_t GROUP, void * PRIVATE), void *DONE_GROUP_DATA)
     Register a callback function which will be called by
     'ext2_get_next_inode' when all of the inodes in a block group have
     been processed.

 -- Function: int ext2fs_inode_scan_flags (ext2_inode_scan SCAN, int
          SET_FLAGS, int CLEAR_FLAGS)

     Set the scan_flags SET_FLAGS and clear the scan_flags CLEAR_FLAGS.
     The following flags can be set using this interface:

     'EXT2_SF_SKIP_MISSING_ITABLE'
          When a block group is missing an inode table, skip it.  If
          this flag is not set 'ext2fs_get_next_inode' will return the
          error EXT2_ET_MISSING_INODE_TABLE.

2.3.3 Iterating over blocks in an inode
---------------------------------------

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_block_iterate (ext2_filsys FS, ext2_ino_t
          INO, int FLAGS, char *block_buf, int (*func)(ext2_filsys FS,
          blk_t *BLOCKNR, int BLOCKCNT, void *PRIVATE), void *PRIVATE)

     Iterate over all of the blocks in inode number INO in filesystem
     FS, by calling the function FUNC for each block in the inode.  The
     BLOCK_BUF parameter should either be NULL, or if the
     'ext2fs_block_iterate' function is called repeatedly, the overhead
     of allocating and freeing scratch memory can be avoided by passing
     a pointer to a scratch buffer which must be at least as big as
     three times the filesystem's blocksize.

     The FLAGS parameter controls how the iterator will function:

     'BLOCK_FLAG_HOLE'
          This flag indiciates that the interator function should be
          called on blocks where the block number is zero (also known as
          "holes".)  It is also known as BLOCK_FLAG_APPEND, since it is
          also used by functions such as ext2fs_expand_dir() to add a
          new block to an inode.

     'BLOCK_FLAG_DEPTH_TRAVERSE'
          This flag indicates that the iterator function for the
          indirect, doubly indirect, etc.  blocks should be called after
          all of the blocks containined in the indirect blocks are
          processed.  This is useful if you are going to be deallocating
          blocks from an inode.

     'BLOCK_FLAG_DATA_ONLY'
          This flag indicates that the iterator function should be
          called for data blocks only.

     The callback function FUNC is called with a number of parameters;
     the FS and PRIVATE parameters are self-explanatory, and their
     values are taken from the parameters to 'ext2fs_block_iterate'.
     (The PRIVATE data structure is generally used by callers to
     'ext2fs_block_iterate' so that some private data structure can be
     passed to the callback function.  The BLOCKCNT parameter, if
     non-negative, indicates the logical block number of a data block in
     the inode.  If BLOCKCNT is less than zero, then FUNC was called on
     a metadata block, and BLOCKCNT will be one of the following values:
     BLOCK_COUNT_IND, BLOCK_COUNT_DIND, BLOCK_COUNT_TIND, or
     BLOCK_COUNT_TRANSLATOR. The BLOCKNR is a pointer to the inode or
     indirect block entry listing physical block number.  The callback
     function may modify the physical block number, if it returns the
     BLOCK_CHANGED flag.

     The callback function FUNC returns a result code which is composed
     of the logical OR of the following flags:

     'BLOCK_CHANGED'

          This flag indicates that callback function has modified the
          physical block number pointed to by BLOCKNR.

     'BLOCK_ABORT'

          This flag requests that 'ext2fs_block_iterate' to stop
          immediately and return to the caller.

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_block_iterate2 (ext2_filsys FS,
          ext2_ino_t INO, int FLAGS, char *BLOCK_buf, int
          (*func)(ext2_filsys FS, blk_t *BLOCKNR, e2_blkcnt_t BLOCKCNT,
          blk_t REF_BLK, int REF_OFFSET, void *PRIVATE), void *PRIVATE)

     This function is much like 'ext2fs_block_iterate', except that the
     BLOCKCNT type is a 64-bit signed quantity, to support larger files,
     and the addition of the REF_BLK and REF_OFFSET arguments passed to
     the callback function, which identify the location of the physical
     block pointed to by pointer BLOCKNR.  If REF_BLK is zero, then
     REF_OFFSET contains the offset into the 'i_blocks' array.  If
     REF_BLK is non-zero, then the physical block location is contained
     inside an indirect block group, and REF_OFFSET contains the offset
     into the indirect block.

 -- Function: int ext2fs_inode_has_valid_blocks (struct ext2_inode
          *INODE)

     Returns 1 if the inode's block entries actually valid block
     entries, and 0 if not.  Inodes which represent devices and fast
     symbolic links do not contain valid block entries.

2.4.1 Directory block functions
-------------------------------

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_read_dir_block (ext2_filsys FS, blk_t
          BLOCK, void *BUF)

     This function reads a directory block, performing any necessary
     byte swapping if necessary.

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_write_dir_block (ext2_filsys FS, blk_t
          BLOCK, void *BUF)

     This function writes a directory block, performing any necessary
     byte swapping if necessary.

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_new_dir_block (ext2_filsys FS, ext2_ino_t
          DIR_INO, ext2_ino_t PARENT_INO, char **BLOCK)

     This function creates a new directory block in BLOCK.  If DIR_INO
     is non-zero, then DIR_INFO and PARENT_INO is used to initialize
     directory entries for '.' and '..', respectively.

2.4.2 Iterating over a directory
--------------------------------

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_dir_iterate (ext2_filsys FS, ext2_ino_t
          DIR, int FLAGS, char *BLOCK_BUF, int (*FUNC)(struct
          ext2_dir_entry *DIRENT, int OFFSET, int BLOCKSIZE, char *BUF,
          void *PRIVATE), void *PRIVATE)

     This function iterates over all of the directory entries in the
     directory DIR, calling the callback function FUNC for each
     directory entry in the directory.  The BLOCK_BUF parameter should
     either be NULL, or if the 'ext2fs_dir_iterate' function is called
     repeatedly, the overhead of allocating and freeing scratch memory
     can be avoided by passing a pointer to a scratch buffer which must
     be at least as big as the filesystem's blocksize.

     The FLAGS parameter controls how the iterator will function:

     'DIRENT_FLAG_INCLUDE_EMPTY'

          This flag indicates that the callback function should be
          called even for deleted or empty directory entries.

----------------------------------------

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_mkdir (ext2_filsys FS, ext2_ino_t PARENT,
          ext2_ino_t INUM, const char *NAME)

     This function creates a new directory.  If INUM is zero, then a new
     inode will be allocated; otherwise, the directory will be created
     in the inode specified by INUM.  If NAME specifies the name of the
     new directory; if it is non-NULL, then the new directory will be
     linked into the parent directory PARENT.

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_expand_dir (ext2_filsys FS, ext2_ino_t
          DIR)

     This function adds a new empty directory block and appends it to
     the directory DIR.  This allows functions such as 'ext2fs_link' to
     add new directory entries to a directory which is full.

---------------------------------------------

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_link (ext2_filsys FS, ext2_ino_t DIR,

     This function adds a new directory entry to the directory DIR, with
     NAME and INO specifying the name and inode number in the directory
     entry, respectively.

     The low 3 bits of the flags field is used to specify the file type
     of inode: (No other flags are currently defined.)

     'EXT2_FT_UNKNOWN'

          The file type is unknown.

     'EXT2_FT_REG_FILE'

          The file type is a normal file.

     'EXT2_FT_DIR'

          The file type is a directory.

     'EXT2_FT_CHRDEV'

          The file type is a character device.

     'EXT2_FT_BLKDEV'

          The file type is a block device.

     'EXT2_FT_FIFO'

          The file type is a named pipe.

     'EXT2_FT_SOCK'

          The file type is a unix domain socket.

     'EXT2_FT_SYMLINK'

          The file type is a symbolic link.

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_unlink (ext2_filsys FS, ext2_ino_t DIR,
          const char *NAME, ext2_ino_t INO, int FLAGS)

     This function removes a directory entry from DIR.  The directory
     entry to be removed is the first one which is matched by NAME and
     INO.  If NAME is non-NULL, the directory entry's name must match
     NAME.  If INO is non-zero, the directory entry's inode number must
     match INO.  No flags are currently defined for 'ext2fs_unlink';
     callers should pass in zero to this parameter.

2.6.2 Directory-block list management
-------------------------------------

The dblist abstraction stores a list of blocks belonging to directories.
This list can be useful when a program needs to interate over all
directory entries in a filesystem; 'e2fsck' does this in pass 2 of its
operations, and 'debugfs' needs to do this when it is trying to turn an
inode number into a pathname.

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_init_dblist (ext2_filsys FS, ext2_dblist
          *RET_DBLIST)

     Creates a dblist data structure and return it in RET_DBLIST.

 -- Function: void ext2fs_free_dblist (ext2_dblist DBLIST)

     Free a dblist data structure.

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_add_dir_block (ext2_dblist DBLIST,
          ext2_ino_t INO, blk_t BLK, int BLOCKCNT)

     Add an entry to the dblist data structure.  This call records the
     fact that block number BLOCKCNT of directory inode INO is stored in
     block BLK.

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_set_dir_block (ext2_dblist DBLIST,
          ext2_ino_t INO, blk_t BLK, int BLOCKCNT)

     Change an entry in the dblist data structure; this changes the
     location of block number BLOCKCNT of directory indoe INO to be
     block BLK.

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_dblist_iterate (ext2_dblist DBLIST, int
          (*func)(ext2_filsys FS, struct ext2_db_entry *DB_INFO, void
          *PRIVATE), void *PRIVATE)

     This iterator calls FUNC for every entry in the dblist data
     structure.

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_dblist_dir_iterate (ext2_dblist DBLIST,
          int flags, char *BLOCK_BUF, int (*func)(ext2_ino_t DIR, int
          ENTRY, struct ext2_dir_entry *DIRENT, int OFFSET, int
          BLOCKSIZE, char *BUF, void *PRIVATE), void *PRIVATE)

     This iterator takes reads in the directory block indicated in each
     dblist entry, and calls FUNC for each directory entry in each
     directory block.  If DBLIST contains all the directory blocks in a
     filesystem, this function provides a convenient way to iterate over
     all directory entries for that filesystem.


File: libext2fs.info,  Node: Inode count functions,  Prev: Directory-block list management,  Up: EXT2 data abstractions

2.6.3 Inode count functions
---------------------------

The icount abstraction is a specialized data type used by 'e2fsck' to
store how many times a particular inode is referenced by the filesystem.
This is used twice; once to store the actual number of times that the
inode is reference; and once to store the claimed number of times the
inode is referenced according to the inode structure.

   This abstraction is designed to be extremely efficient for storing
this sort of information, by taking advantage of the following
properties of inode counts, namely (1) inode counts are very often zero
(because the inode is currrently not in use), and (2) many files have a
inode count of 1 (because they are a file which has no additional hard
links).

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_create_icount2 (ext2_filsys FS, int
          FLAGS, int SIZE, ext2_icount_t HINT, ext2_icount_t *RET)

     Creates an icount stucture for a filesystem FS, with initial space
     for SIZE inodes whose count is greater than 1.  The FLAGS parameter
     is either 0 or 'EXT2_ICOUNT_OPT_INCREMENT', which indicates that
     icount structure should be able to increment inode counts quickly.
     The icount structure is returned in RET.  The returned icount
     structure initially has a count of zero for all inodes.

     The HINT parameter allows the caller to optionally pass in another
     icount structure which is used to initialize the array of inodes
     whose count is greater than 1.  It is used purely as a speed
     optimization so that the icount structure can determine in advance
     which inodes are likely to contain a count grater than 1.

 -- Function: void ext2fs_free_icount (ext2_icount_t ICOUNT)

     Frees an icount structure.

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_icount_fetch (ext2_icount_t ICOUNT,

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_icount_increment (ext2_icount_t ICOUNT,
          ext2_ino_t INO, __u16 *RET)

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_icount_decrement (ext2_icount_t ICOUNT,
          ext2_ino_t INO, __u16 *RET)

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_icount_store (ext2_icount_t ICOUNT,

     Sets the reference count for inode INO to be COUNT.

 -- Function: ext2_ino_t ext2fs_get_icount_size (ext2_icount_t ICOUNT)

     Returns the current number of inodes in ICOUNT which has a count
     greater than 1.

 -- Function: errcode_t ext2fs_icount_validate (ext2_icount_t ICOUNT,
          FILE *F)

     Validates the internal rep invariant of ICOUNT; if there are any
     problems, print out debugging information to F.  This function is
     intended for debugging and testing use only.

   /* version.c */

 -- Function: int ext2fs_get_library_version (const char **VER_STRING,
          const char **DATE_STRING)

     This function returns the current version of the ext2 library.  The
     return value contains an integer version code, which consists of
     the major version number of the library multiplied by 100, plus the
     minor version number of the library.  Hence, if the library version
     is 1.08, the returned value will be 108.

     If VER_STRING and/or DATE_STRING are non-NULL, they will be set to
     point at a constant string containing the library version and/or
     release date, respectively.

 -- Function: int ext2fs_parse_version_string (const char *VER_STRING)

     This function takes a version string which may included in an
     application and returns a version code using the same algorithm
     used by 'ext2fs_get_library_version'.  It can be used by programs
     included in the 'e2fsprogs' distribution to assure that they are
     using an up-to-date ext2 shared library.

   /* inline functions */
 -- Function: int ext2fs_group_of_blk (ext2_filsys FS, blk_t BLK)

     This function returns the block group which contains the block BLK.

 -- Function: int ext2fs_group_of_ino (ext2_filsys FS, ext2_ino_t INO)

     This function returns the block group which contains the inode INO.
